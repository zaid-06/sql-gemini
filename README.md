Description: Developed a system using the Gemini LLM model and Python to convert text queries into SQL commands.
The backend uses SQLite for database management, and the frontend is built with Streamlit. Example query: "What is the name whose salary is 5000?" 
The system translates this into an SQL query and retrieves the relevant data.

Technologies: Python, Gemini LLM, SQLite, Streamlit
